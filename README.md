## Description
Need a fast and efficient way to store information about the employees that work for your company? Look no further! I've created a database using SQL and Typescript that helps small business owners store information about each employee, such as their name, role, salary, department they work in, and their manager. Also, the database also holds information about each department and the roles each employee has.

 ## Installation
First, make sure Typescript is installed by typing "npm install -D typescript" in your terminal. Once Typescript is installed, make sure to install packages dotenv, pg, inquirer, and express. This can be done by typing "npm i (package name)" in your terminal for each. After you've installed the necessary packages, type "npm run build" to compile the program, then type "npm run start" to run the program.

 ## Usage
This project can be used by anyone who needs a simple database to store information about their employees, their roles, and the departments their company currently has. Also, there are functions that allow you to add an employee, update an employee role, add a role, and add a department. For an example of how this program is used, please view the sample video here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kVaAvtkaRLg7Hl3XmiC_dpgVcXzo2lBe/view

 ## Contribution
 Contributions are always welcome. I'm always open to ideas on how to improve my projects, so please feel free to fork the repo and create a pull request! Also, thank you to W3Schools for helping me with the SQL code I needed to make this program work successfully!

 ## Tests
 While the program is running, you can test it by using samples and checking to see if those samples are properly stored in the database. For an example of how to use the program, please check the video above in the Usage section. Also, to delete these samples, you have to go into the SQL code and use DELETE functions to remove it for now. Later, I will add delete functionality to the program that will accomplish that task.
